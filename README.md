# 📰 Financial News Impact Analysis

This repository contains the setup and development for **Financial News Impact Analysis**, a hands-on financial analytics challenge.

The project explores how real-world financial news headlines influence stock price movements by combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **technical indicators**, and **quantitative correlation analysis**.

It includes:

- A reproducible Python data science environment
- Proper `.gitignore` and dependency management
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for clean installs
- Structured code for sentiment analysis, EDA, and time-series modeling

The goal is to uncover actionable insights by linking headline sentiment to daily stock returns and suggesting predictive strategies for future price movement.
